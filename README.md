## About the Project
This project focuses on building a Transformer-Based Visual Question Answering (VQA) system to enhance CCTV surveillance. The system allows users to ask natural language questions about CCTV images or video frames and receive accurate answers based on visual understanding.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Vision Transformers (ViT)  
- BERT / GPT  

## Project Summary
The proposed system integrates computer vision and natural language processing using transformer models. Vision Transformers (ViT) are used to extract visual features from CCTV footage, while transformer-based language models such as BERT or GPT are used to understand user queries. Both modalities are combined using attention mechanisms to generate meaningful answers.

Compared to traditional CNN-RNN systems, this approach provides better contextual reasoning, scalability, and robustness. The system can be useful in real-time surveillance, security monitoring, and intelligent analysis of visual data, enabling more efficient and automated decision-making.
